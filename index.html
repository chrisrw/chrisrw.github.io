                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I am a junior web developer, a gamer, and an explorer.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My passion for being a developer started back in 2016 when I observed a friend of mine working as a web developer. I would watch him work and I decided that it was something I should check out for myself. I started using free resources to teach myself the fundamentals of coding and I loved it. At the time, I thought the only way you could get a job as a developer was to have a computer science degree. So I decided to put being a developer on the back burner while I pursued other jobs that aligned with my degree. 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    Fast forward to mid 2019 and I am not happy with the work I was doing. I started looking online to see if there were any other ways to become a developer and saw that coding bootcamps were another option of learning what was needed to enter to job market as a junior developer. I took the risk, quit my job to enter the General Assembly Software Engineering Remote full-time program, and have been excitedly working to sharpen my skills all day, every day. </p>
